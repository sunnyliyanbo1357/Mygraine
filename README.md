# Mygraine

Migraine Headaches are sometimes-debilitating neurological condition faced by nearly 1 in 4 households in the US. 
There is insufficient research on the day to day triggers and symptommanagement of the condition and insufficient tools for patients to manage their own self-care and optimize prevention and treatment. 
And for the physicians, clinical decisions are made with difficulties based on patients vague memory. 
MyMigraine is using a smart phone and smart watch for novel data capture and using an image-based questionnaire to assess the severity level of patientâ€™s migraine status, which effectively minimize the patient's effort for migraine data input. 
It also visualizes the data for patients to explore personal triggers, and also for the physicians to make supported clinical decisions.
